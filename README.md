#Installation#

This project uses [CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org) to manage its dependencies. 

You **must** launch XCode using the *SimpliSafe.xcworkspace* file and **not** the *SimpliSafe.xcodeproj* file.

#Disclamer#

Please understand that I am not affiliated with SimpliSafe, Inc. This is a personal project that uses their unofficial APIs to control my alarm system.
