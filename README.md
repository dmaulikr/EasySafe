#Installation#

This project uses [CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org) to manage its dependencies. 

You **must** launch XCode using the *SimpliSafe.xcworkspace* file and **not** the *SimpliSafe.xcodeproj* file.

#Disclamer#

Please understand that I am not affiliated with SimpliSafe, Inc. This is a personal project that uses their unofficial APIs to control my alarm system. 

#Feedback#

I welcome feedback and pull requests.

#License#

MIT license. I don't care what you do with this, but know that the current SimpliSafe API is unofficial and probably not something I'd base a commercial product on since it wasn't designed for this kind of use.
